"""Joystick-driven checks of Swarm stage 1 (M4): the player, the player's shots, the panel and stars.

`make test` can't press buttons, so this drives joystick port 2 through the VICE monitor (the
"I/O simulation" joyport device, as tests/engine/input/check.py does) on the GAME build (not the
AUTOPLAY budget build). The machine is stopped at game_update_end in EVERY frame (after that
frame's input_read and update routines, before mux_update); the stick is changed while it is
stopped and the state is read at the next stop, so each sample is exactly one game frame later.

Expected values are the design's (docs/games/swarm/design.md): X 24-318, 3 px a frame, start 171,
Y 221; shots spawn at (player X, 213), move 8 a frame, are removed when Y < 46, at most 2, with a
10-frame cooldown.

Cases (PASS/FAIL each, exit code 1 on any failure):
  setup        $D011 = $5B, $D018 = $1A, $D020/21/22 = black/black/blue, $D017 = $D01D = 0,
               $01 = $35, $DC02 = 0; mux_flags = $80 for sprites 0-3 and 0 for 4-23; player at
               (171, 221), shape $C0; enemy shots and enemies hidden
  charset      $2800-$29FF is the ROM's glyphs with codes 27-29 patched ('A' and '0' spot-checked
               against known ROM bytes, the three custom glyphs against one-pixel / ship shapes)
  panel        all 40 cells of row 24 hold a code in $40-$7F with white colour RAM; SCORE, HI and
               WAVE at the design's columns; 000000, 005000, 01; ships at 35-36, blank at 37
  stars        exactly 48 star glyphs in rows 0-23, none in columns 10-29 of rows 5, 9, 11, 12,
               13, 16, 19; every star's colour is one of white / light grey / grey / dark grey
  twinkle      over 96 frames exactly one colour RAM cell changes each frame, always a star's,
               each star changes every 48 frames, stepping white > light grey > grey > dark grey
  idle         nothing pressed for 10 frames: X stays 171, no shot
  up-down      up, then down, 10 frames each: nothing moves, no shot
  right        held: X + 3 every frame from 171 to 318 (49 frames), then stays at 318 for 20
  left         held: X - 3 every frame from 318 to 24 in 98 frames (feel target 1), stays for 20
  stop         right for 5 frames, released: X doesn't change in the frame of the release or after
  left+right   both held 10 frames: no movement (the game's choice: they cancel)
  fire-hold    fire held 200 frames: never more than 2 shots; each spawns at (player X, 213),
               moves - 8 a frame, is last seen at Y 53 and lives 21 frames; no two spawns closer
               than 10 frames; the spawn frames are printed (0, 10, 21, 31, 42, ...)
  fire-move    fire + right held: each shot keeps the X the player had when it was fired
  cooldown     fire held while each shot is removed (by this script, through the monitor) the
               frame after it spawns, so a slot is always free: spawns are exactly 10 frames apart
  fire-tap     fire pressed for 1 frame: exactly one shot; pressed again 5 frames later: none
               (cooldown); pressed at 10 frames: a second shot
  sprites      the hardware sprite registers the multiplexer wrote: sprite 0 at the player's X and
               Y in the player's colour (read from colour_table), no expansion

Run from the repo root (build first: make GAME=swarm):

    uv run --package budget-runner python tests/games/swarm/check.py [--prg build/swarm/swarm.prg]

Takes about 5 s. Works on a release build too (make BUILD=release GAME=swarm): it uses no DEBUG
label. Results of the last run: tests/games/swarm/check_results.txt.
